My name is Jade Haney. I am excited to display my work via GitHub and this is my first repo.

I created this page to daily practice skills that I learn in my Thinkful journey. This page will display my progress as a web developer and I'm excited about developing this project.

What you see on this webpage was inspired by what I've learned so far in "Module 1: Introduction to HTML and CSS fundamentals."
